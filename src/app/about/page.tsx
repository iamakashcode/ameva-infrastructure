              <p>
                In 2011, four years into the business, a labour contractor
                abandoned one of our sites midway through a slab pour. We spent
                eleven weeks and a great deal of money making it right, and then
                made a decision that has defined the company since: we would
                never again hand construction to somebody whose name was not on
                our payroll.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today the in-house construction division runs to 52 people and is still expanding —
                engineers, supervisors, finishing crews and a quality cell that
                reports to the board rather than to the project manager. It is
                slower to scale than the alternative and it is the single reason
                a bathroom in a 2015 project looks the same as one poured this
                year.

              <p>
                The rest followed from that. If you control the build, you can
                publish the specification. If you can publish the specification,
                you can put a penalty on the delivery date. And if you can do
                both, you stop needing to oversell in the brochure.
